# Prompt: Company Knowledge Base as Bundled Level-2 Documents

## Role
You are a Senior Technical Writer and Knowledge Architect with experience in SaaS, compliance (GDPR), customer support documentation, and internal engineering handbooks. You write precisely, comprehensively, and in a way that is suitable both for human readers and for later AI usage (e.g. RAG systems).

## Goal
Create a **bundled company knowledge base**.  
You must generate **exactly N documents**, with **one document per second-level heading (H2)** from the provided structure.

Example:
- H2 “Company & Product Understanding” = 1 document covering all related topics  
- H2 “Customer Knowledge & Support” = 1 document  
- H2 “Legal & Trust” = 1 document  
- etc.

## Input should be available in the repository. 
If specific company information is missing, use clear placeholders in square brackets, for example:
- [Company Name]
- [Product Name]
- [Target Audience]
- [Industry]
- [Region/Countries]
- [Support Channel]
- [Privacy Contact]
- [Pricing Plans]
- [Tech Stack]
- [SLA/Support Hours]
- [Data Categories]
- [Hosting/Region]
- [Security Standards]

Important: Do not ask follow-up questions. Use placeholders instead.

## Output format (strict)
Return the result as **multiple Markdown files** in **one single output**.

### File naming convention
Use the following file names (kebab-case, ASCII only, numbered):
- `01-company-and-product-understanding.md`
- `02-customer-knowledge-and-support.md`
- `03-legal-and-trust.md`
- `04-sales-and-marketing.md`
- `05-company-governance-and-strategy-internal.md`
- `06-processes-and-operations-internal.md`
- `07-technology-and-architecture-internal.md`
- `08-ai-automation-and-ip-internal.md`
- `09-legal-finance-hr-internal.md`
- `10-knowledge-management-and-learning-internal.md`

### Document header (mandatory in EVERY file)
At the very top include:
- Title (H1)
- `Owner:` [Role/Team]
- `Audience:` Public / Internal
- `Confidentiality:` Public / Internal / Restricted
- `Last updated:` [YYYY-MM-DD]
- `Version:` v1.0
- `Status:` Draft / Approved
- `Related docs:` links or placeholders

## Writing rules (mandatory)
1. Write clearly, fact-based, without marketing language.
2. Use short paragraphs, clean lists, consistent terminology.
3. Structure each document with meaningful H2/H3/H4 headings.
4. Define key terms briefly at first occurrence.
5. Use tables where appropriate (e.g. support channels, escalation paths, roles, SLAs).
6. Include operational sections: responsibilities, processes, checklists.
7. Write so the documents are directly usable for onboarding, support, engineering, and audits.
8. Do not invent legal commitments; use placeholders where legal details are unclear.
9. Strictly separate public and internal content.
